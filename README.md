# Hello, 👋 I'm Hussain Al-Hasan

## 💼 About Me

I'm a System & Business Analyst, Product Owner, and Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience helping startups and companies turn complex ideas into simple, working solutions.

I combine strong analytical thinking with hands-on technical expertise to bridge the gap between business goals and real-world execution. I've crafted over **400+ professional documents** — including BRDs, FRDs, SRS, and market analyses — that guide teams with clarity and precision. Whether it's translating vision into user stories, mapping As-Is/To-Be workflows with Lucidchart, or managing delivery in Agile teams — I make sure everything connects smoothly.

I've worked with 20+ businesses across industries to shape and launch digital products, optimize internal processes, and bring clarity to cross-functional teams. My background in Flutter, Laravel, and React allows me to communicate clearly with both developers and decision-makers — without anything getting lost in translation. I also designed and developed my own personal website using Next.js, combining all my expertise into a clean, strategic digital presence.

Beyond documentation, I focus on user experience, product planning, agile project management, technical architecture, and emerging AI technologies like **Prompt Engineering** to ensure projects are scoped, designed, and delivered successfully.
